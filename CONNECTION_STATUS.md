# 🎉 SuiGym Backend-Frontend Connection Status

## ✅ Successfully Connected!

Your SuiGym backend has been successfully connected to the frontend. Here's what was accomplished:

### 🔧 Configuration Updates

1. **Network Configuration**: Updated to use TESTNET
2. **Package ID**: Set to your deployed contract: `0xe3a869880f44115089b93b73e98db0c54c7d7ee59324d6b1e91d70b78811a5b7`
3. **Function Calls**: Fixed parameter types to match Move contract expectations

### 🛠️ Fixed Issues

1. **Network Mismatch**: Frontend was pointing to testnet but config was set to devnet
2. **Variable Names**: Fixed `userProfile` vs `profile` inconsistency in App.tsx
3. **Function Parameters**: Updated transaction block calls to use proper Sui.js syntax:
   - `txb.pure.string()` for strings
   - `txb.pure.option()` for optional values
   - `txb.pure.vector()` for arrays
   - `txb.pure.u64()` for numbers

### 📦 Contract Verification

✅ Package exists on Sui Testnet  
✅ Wellness module is accessible  
✅ All required functions are available:
- `create_profile`
- `log_workout_detailed` 
- `update_weight`

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the frontend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Connect your wallet** using the same address that deployed the contract:
   - Address: `0x26eb85673991778fe6f5be7916a0fa7b4ca7cb0eefb96606f70735cc32342475`

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Click "Connect Wallet" 
   - Create a profile with username and optional starting weight
   - Log a workout
   - Update your weight

## 🔍 What to Expect

- **Weight Updates**: Should update your profile's current weight and calculate weight loss

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools to see any error messages
2. **Verify Network**: Ensure your wallet is connected to Sui Testnet
3. **Gas Fees**: Make sure you have sufficient SUI for transaction fees
4. **Transaction Status**: Check transaction results in the console logs
